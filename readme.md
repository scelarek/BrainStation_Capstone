## **COVIDCast: Predict to Protect**  
## **BrainStation**
</div>


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
<div align="center">
Like a weather forecast for pandemics, COVIDCast leverages state-of-the-art machine learning and epidemiological models to deliver precise outbreak predictions.
</div>


During COVID 19, the unknown course of the pandemic is almost as deadly as the virus itself. **COVIDCast** aims to address this problem by Predicting to Protect. That is to say, it uses times series and epidemiological models to forecast the next 14 days of new COVID cases so governments, hospitals, and people can prepare for the coming storm.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The data for this project comes from three sources: 

- [Google Open COVID Project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data)
- [OWID COVID dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- [COVSIRPHY Library](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/blob/main/README.md)

These repositories gathered data from a number of sources all over the world including the WHO, John Hopkins Hospital, and the CDC. I used 6 different csv's in the master file, combining together mobility data (Google), weather data (Google), government restrictions (Google), hospitalizations and tests (OWID), case counts and epidemiological variables (CovsirPhy). There was some overlap in the datasets from each source, but this was used to help impute missing data in the other datasets to create a more complete final [master_df](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Data/master_df.parquet).

## ðŸ§¹ [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Capstone/1.%20COVIDCast%20Preprocessing.ipynb)
Originally 30% of the data was missing. I used a variety of techniques to make this data more manageable:

- **Imputation**: Missing values in one column would be imputed from another column if they had the same information (eg: current hospitalizations, fatalities). 
- **Interpolation**: Missing values within a continuous feature with an underlying exponential growth curve would be interpolated using polynomial order 2 (eg: excess mortality, SIRD variables). 
- **Forward Filling**: Missing values that were only updated if changed were filled forward, and assumed to be zero before the first value (eg: vaccine policy, school closings)
- **Filling with Zeros**: Missing values for data that would be zero because it wasn't possible until a certain date would be filled with zeros (eg: vaccines pre-2020 September).
- **Trimming the Horizons**: Many variables were not available until 2020-02-15 (current hospitalizations) or after 2023-03-22 (fatalities), therefore I used this as the beginning and end dates.
- **Dropping Columns:** At the time of modeling, I decided I wanted to have as up to date information as possible. So I dropped many columns that didn't have data past 2022-09-15 (eg: all the mobility and weather data).

## ðŸ‘“ [EDA](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Capstone/2.%20COVIDCast%20EDA.ipynb)
To properly apply time series models to the data, I had to assess: 

- **Stationarity**: Ensure stationarity using various differencing orders
- **Target Normality**: Check the COVID Case numbers for normality and performed a BoxCox tranformation of the data
- **PACF and ACF**: Look at the PACF and ACF correllelograms to determine AR and MA orders respectively
- **Seasonality**: Apply seasonal decomposition and find the lag for seasonality

Here is my [Preprocessing and EDA Presentation](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Presentations/COVID%20Preprocessing%20and%20EDA.pdf)

## ðŸ’  Modeling

COVIDCast works by taking the output of the Epidemiological SIRD model and plugging that into the time series model to give it better information about the underlying nature of the disease being predicted. 

### ðŸ¦  Epidemiological Model Overview

- **SIRD Model**: The SIRD (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased) model offers insights into real-time disease spread. It estimates the rate of change for different populations (susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased) and computes the reproductive rate of the disease known as \( R_0 \) (pronounced 'R naught'). This was computed in the beginning of the Preprocessing Notebook using the CovsirPhy library.

### ðŸ§ª Time Series Forecasting Algorithms

- [**ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX models**](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Capstone/3.%20COVIDCast%20SARIMAX%20Model.ipynb): These models predict future trends using moving averages, linear autoregression, and differencing. They also incorporate seasonality and exogenous variables, making them potent tools for forecasting. However they don't model nonlinear trends very well and they require a lot of prior programming by the forecaster.

- [**Prophet model**](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Capstone/4.%20COVIDCast%20Prophet%20Model.ipynb): From Facebook's own description, "Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects." 
  

## ðŸ”¢ [Feature Selection and Tuning the Models](https://github.com/scelarek/Covid-Prediction-Capstone/blob/main/Capstone/3.%20COVIDCast%20SARIMAX%20Model.ipynb):
For ARIMA time series models, I wanted to added exogenous variables that have information about how a target is going to fluctuate in the next time steps. To determine these features I had to assess each variables' Stationarity, Granger-Causality, Linear Correlation Strength, Multi-Collinearity, and Importance. Eventually though I found that 6 variables I thought to be important due to background knowledge, were actually the best additional regressors for the model. I used autoarima for grid searching order, but eventually found my own discovered model orders of `(3,0,2) (2, 1, 1) [7] with intercept` to be the most predictive. 

For Prophet modeling, I grid searched with cross-validation through up to 15 of the most important features as determined by Recursive Feature Elimination with LGMBoost as my regressor to select for the most predictive features. This directly led to my final model with 11 exogenous variables. I then tuned this grid searched over the hyperparameters to land on the final settings of `changepoint_prior_scale`=10 , `seasonality_prior_scale`=0.01, `holidays_prior_scale`=10, and `growth`='linear'. 


### ðŸ“ˆ Results and Performance

The models were trained on new cases of COVID from February 15th, 2020 to March 5th, 2023. The unseen test data from March 5th to March 21st, 2023 served as the evaluation benchmark.
