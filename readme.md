Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on COVID-19 Prediction using advanced machine learning techniques and ODE modeling. This project, undertaken in August 2023, aims to predict the spread and impact of COVID-19 using SARIMAX, Facebook Profit Model, and RNN with features derived from cutting-edge epidemiological models of pandemics.

### ðŸš€ Project Breakdown

My project is broken down into four main parts:

1. **Cleaning**: Dive into my process of data preprocessing and cleaning in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/scelarek/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/d2dcb369dbfd98b2e8954b0028a0293529448294/Capstone/1.%20Covid%20Preprocessing.ipynb).
2. **EDA**: Explore the basic exploratory data analysis I performed in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/scelarek/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/d2dcb369dbfd98b2e8954b0028a0293529448294/Capstone/2.%20Sample%20EDA%20(Basic).ipynb).
3. **Initial Modeling**: Description and links to be added.
4. **Advanced Modeling**: Description and links to be added.

### ðŸ’¡ Resources

I have organized my functions, libraries, and primary clean data file for easy access:  

- **Functions and Libraries**: Access the core functions and libraries used for this project in this [Python file](https://github.com/scelarek/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/d2dcb369dbfd98b2e8954b0028a0293529448294/Capstone/capstone_functions.py).
- **Main Clean Data File**: The primary cleaned data file is available in [this parquet file](https://github.com/scelarek/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/d2dcb369dbfd98b2e8954b0028a0293529448294/Data/master_df.parquet).
- **Presentation Preprocessing and Clean:**  This is a presentation of the [Preprocessing and EDA.](https://github.com/scelarek/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/e824c901efdb0adf1783256664bcfe054ae51001/Presentations/COVID%20Preprocessing%20and%20EDA.pdf)
