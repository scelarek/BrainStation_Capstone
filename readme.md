## ðŸŒŸ Introduction 

<div align="center">
Like a weather forecast for pandemics, COVIDCast leverages state-of-the-art machine learning and epidemiological models to deliver precise outbreak predictions.

### Problem Statement
Three years ago, the emergence of COVID-19 drastically impacted the world. While COVID-19 was a significant challenge, the overarching threat of pandemics looms even larger. Experts from organizations like the WHO, alongside various independent research teams, have highlighted pandemics as one of the most significant threats to humanity. The statistics are daunting: there's a 1 in 30 chance that a pandemic could pose severe challenges to our existence in the upcoming century.

### My Mission

My goal with this project is straightforward: **Predict to Protect**. 

If we can anticipate the number of new cases, we stand a better chance of mitigating its impact. COVIDCast is unique, leveraging the principles of the epidemiological SIRD model combined with advanced time series forecasting algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and the Prophet model.

- **Time series forecasting algorithms:** The ARIMA and Prophet models predict future trends using the moving average, recent values, and differencing to predict the value of the target variable at the next time step. These models can also incorporate the information gained from seasonality and exogenous variables -- which is where the Epidemiological Models come in. 
- **Epidemiological Model Overview**: Traditional epidemiological container models, such as the SIRD (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased), offer foundational insights into disease spread in real time. SIRD does this by estimating the most recent rate of change for for susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased populations then using it to compute the reproductive rate of the disease called R0 (pronounced 'R not'). This reproductive rate is the main value that I will be plugging into my time series forecasting models as an exogenous variable.


My integrated approach captures the assumptions and knowledge of pandemics that experts have while using the power of time series models to predict seasonal trends and daily fluctuations.


### Results and Model Performance on Test Scores
The Time Series models were trained on COVID data from Februaury 15th 2020 to March 25th 2023, then tested on their results for the unseen test data 2023 1-25-2023 -> 2-09-2023)


SARIMAX and Prophet both enhanced by features derived from the SIRD model of the pandemics infectiousness.
