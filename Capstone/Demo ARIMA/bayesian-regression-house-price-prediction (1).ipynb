(eg. location, size, condition, time), these factors can change quite substantially from one property to another\n","- The housing market itself is quite a volatile industry, and is quite dependent on demand and supply fluctuations, not to even mention economic factors sch as interest rates & inflation, so its quite a challenge to predict the price variation over time\n","- It's also quite challenging to predict housing prices due to the limited data that is available, most datasets contain a limited number of features related to each property, such is why feature engineering is quite important\n","- As a result, it is generally quite difficult to accurately predict property prices that take into account all the factors that influence it\n","- The California housing dataaset
