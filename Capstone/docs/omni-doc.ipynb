    "To download or use the data, you must agree to the Google [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This aggregated, anonymized dataset shows trends in search patterns for symptoms and is intended to help researchers to better understand the impact of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public health experts indicated that trends in search patterns might be helpful in broadly understanding how COVID-19 impacts communities and even in detecting outbreaks earlier. You shouldn’t assume that the data is a recording of real-world clinical events, or use this data for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the data, try exploring these [interactive charts and map of symptom search trends](https://pair-code.github.io/covid19_symptom_dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this data\n",
    "This data reflects the volume of Google searches for a broad set of symptoms, signs and health conditions. *To keep things simple in this documentation, we will refer to all of these collectively as symptoms*. The data covers hundreds of symptoms such as *fever*, *difficulty breathing*, and *stress*—based on the following:\n",
    "- a symptom’s prevalence in Google’s searches\n",
    "- data quality and privacy considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day, we count the searches mapped to each of these symptoms and organize the data by geographic region. The resulting dataset is a daily or weekly time series for each region showing the relative frequency of searches for each symptom.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single search query can be mapped to more than one symptom. For example, we map a search for “acid reflux and coughing up mucus” to three symptoms: *Cough*, *Gastroesophageal reflux disease*, and *Heartburn*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset covers the recent period and we’ll gradually expand its range as part of regular updates. Each update will bring the coverage to within three days of the day of the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we are releasing the dataset in English, we count searches in other languages. In each supported country, we include the languages needed to cover the majority of symptom search queries. For example, in the United States we support Spanish and English.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data represents a sample of our users and might not represent the exact behavior of a wider population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preserving privacy\n",
    "For this dataset, we use [differential privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc&feature=youtu.be), which adds artificial noise to our datasets while enabling high quality results without identifying any individual person.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further protect people’s privacy, we ensure that no personal information or individual search queries are included in the dataset, and we don’t link any search-based health inferences to an individual user. More information about the privacy methods used to generate the dataset can be found in this [report][1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we process the data\n",
    "We’d like to report symptoms for each day, but sometimes we can’t do this. When the daily volume of the data for a given region does not meet quality or privacy thresholds, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to provide a given symptom at the weekly resolution.\n",
    "2. If we cannot meet our quality or privacy thresholds at the weekly resolution, we don't provide the data for the symptom in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, in a given region, some symptoms are available at a daily resolution while others are only available at weekly resolution. To make it easier to compare a wider range of symptoms within the same region, whenever daily data is available we also produce an aggregate weekly value computed from the individual daily (Monday to Sunday) values. We use this reaggregation approach for privacy reasons, as we cannot directly compute both daily and weekly versions of the same data. We refer to these values as weekly-from-daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the reaggregation, the weekly-from-daily data has slightly more noise than the weekly data computed directly. The absolute magnitude of errors in the weekly-from-daily data time series is limited: under 15% for all the symptoms (aggregated over all weeks and locations), and under 10% for most symptoms. The errors are symmetrically distributed, suggesting that the weekly-from-daily values provide an unbiased estimate of the true weekly average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a symptom-region pair is available in both the daily and weekly time series, then the weekly estimates are aggregated from the daily values. Otherwise, they’re computed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the addition of the weekly-from-daily values, in a given region, symptoms might appear in both the daily and weekly time series, only in the latter, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shows the *relative popularity* of symptoms in searches within a geographical region. To normalize and scale the daily and the weekly time series (processed separately), we do the following for each region:\n",
    "1. First, we count the number of searches for each symptom in that region for that day/week.\n",
    "2. Next, we divide this count by the total number of Search users in the region for that day/week to calculate relative popularity (which can be interpreted as the probability that a user in this region will search for the given symptom on that day/week). We refer to this ratio as the *normalized popularity* of a symptom.\n",
    "3. We then find the maximum value of the *normalized popularity* across the entire published time range for that region, over all symptoms using the chosen time resolution (day/week). We scale this maximum value to 100. All the other values are mapped to proportionally smaller values (linear scaling) in the range 0-100.\n",
    "4. Finally, we store the scaling factor and use it to scale values (for the same region and time resolution) in subsequent releases. In future updates, when a symptom popularity exceeds the previously-observed maximum value (found in step 3), the new scaled values may be larger than 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each region and time resolution, we scale all the normalized popularities using the same scaling factor. In a single region, you can compare the relative popularity of two (or more) symptoms (at the same time resolution) over any time interval. You can also compare a weekly-from-daily value with another weekly value because they share the same scaling factor. However, you shouldn’t compare the values of symptom popularity across regions or time resolutions — the region- and time-resolution-specific scalings make these comparisons meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We adopted a new scaling factor for the US weekly data across all symptoms starting on Dec 15, 2020. While the numbers for normalized search volume changed on this date, the normalized search volumes retain their interpretation relative to each other.*\n",

    "This dataset characterizes access to COVID-19 vaccination sites based on travel times. We’re releasing this data to help public health officials, researchers, and healthcare providers to identify areas with insufficient access, deploy interventions, and research these issues—you shouldn’t use this dataset for other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the data, try exploring the [Vaccine Equity Planner](https://vaccineplanner.org/) tool by [Ariadne Labs](https://www.ariadnelabs.org/) and [Boston Children’s Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/), which is powered by this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "This data shows *catchment areas* surrounding COVID-19 vaccination sites (sometimes called *facilities*). A catchment area represents the area within which a site can be reached within a designated period of time. Each vaccination site has a number of catchment areas, each representing a combination of a typical traveling time (for example, 15 minutes or less) and mode of transport (such as, walking, driving, or public transport).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data covers vaccination sites in the US that are known to Google and will be refreshed weekly, reflecting changes in the availability and accessibility of vaccination sites. We’ll explore expanding to other regions as we obtain further vaccination site and geospatial information, as well as feedback from public health organizations, researchers, and users of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset uses Google Maps Platform [Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview), the same one that helps calculate directions in Google Maps. The dataset doesn’t rely on any user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we process the data\n",
    "First, we gather a list of the vaccination sites in a country from authoritative sources, such as  government, retail pharmacies, and data aggregators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we divide the territory of each country into roughly square regions of approximately 600m x 600m. The vaccination sites (destinations) and the starting points of a journey (sources) are treated as if at the centers of these squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to compute the catchment area boundaries we do the following for each vaccination site:\n",
    "* Using Google Maps’ [Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview) we compute the travel time and distance required to reach that site from all the squares in its vicinity (up to a radius of 50 km).\n",
    "* For public transit systems, we compute journey times for the most recent Tuesday morning. This period reflects rush-hour travel schedules and reduces distortion from long weekends.\n",
    "* To compute the catchment boundary for a particular mode of transport and particular travel time threshold:\n",
    "  * We unify all squares in the vicinity of the site that can be reached using the chosen mode of transport within the chosen travel time.\n",
    "  * We draw a boundary surrounding the unified area.\n",
    "  * To optimize the data, we smooth the boundary while minimizing the distortion of the original shape.\n",

    "2. **Vaccination intent**. Searches related to eligibility, availability, and accessibility of vaccines. For example, “covid vaccine near me” or “safeway covid vaccine”.\n",
    "3. **Safety and side effects**. Searches related to the safety and side effects of the vaccines. For example, “is the covid vaccine safe” or “pfizer vaccine side effects”.\n",

    "We selected these categories based on the input from public health experts, as well as taking into consideration:\n",
    "- data quality—for example, clear user intent\n",
    "- privacy—for example, significant search volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "A search classified in a subcategory, always also counts towards the parent “COVID-19 vaccination category”, however some COVID-19 vaccination searches may be classified in the parent category but neither subcategory (an example would be queries about COVID-19 vaccine brands).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data covers the period starting Jan 2021 to the present. We’ll offer weekly updates covering the most recent week (Mon-Sun). Each update will be available a few days after the week ends—to allow time for data processing and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These trends represent Google Search users and might not represent the exact behavior of a wider population. We expect, however, that any systematic regional biases will remain stable over the period covered by the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we process the data\n",
    "The data shows the relative interest in each of the search categories within a geographical region. To generate, normalize, and scale the weekly time series we do the following for each region—let’s consider an example region A:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we count the queries classified in each of the categories in region A for that week. To determine the region, we [estimate the location](https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data) where the query was made. When counting the queries, a given anonymous search user can contribute at most once to each category per day, and to at most 3 different categories per day.\n",
    "2. Next, we divide this count by the total volume of queries (on any topic, not just those related to COVID-19 vaccination) in region A for that week to calculate relative interest. We call this proportion the *normalized interest* of a category. This is a relatively small number, which reflects the fraction of all search queries in that region that are related to the topic of COVID-19 vaccination or one of its subcategories. <br/>\n",
    "**(Initial release only)** We establish a *fixed scaling factor* by finding the maximum weekly value of the normalized interest for the general COVID-19 vaccination category, at the US national level (which occured on the week starting at March 8). We scale this maximum value to 100 by multiplying it by a number which we set as the *fixed scaling factor*. We store the fixed scaling factor, and in subsequent updates we use it to scale values in all regions.\n",
    "3. Finally, using our fixed scaling factor, we linearly scale all the other normalized interest values, across regions, categories, and time. These values can be lower or higher than 100 (but not less than 0). We call these values *scaled normalized interest*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all scaled normalized interest values share the same scaling factor, you can do the following:\n",
    "- Compare the relative interest of categories across all regions over any time interval.\n",
    "- Calculate the fraction of COVID-19 vaccination queries that focus on the topic of vaccination intent. To do this for a region, divide the *scaled normalized interest* of the *Vaccination intent* or *Safety and side effects* categories by the *COVID-19 vaccination* category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it’s not possible to report trends for every region. When the weekly volume of data for a given region doesn't meet quality or privacy thresholds, we cannot provide data for some or all categories in that region. In such cases, the data for that region will still be counted in its parent region. For example, data for all the counties in the US state of Nebraska will be counted as part of Nebraska’s state trends. Because we omit the data for regions where the search volume doesn't meet our quality or privacy thresholds, we compute the data for each region directly from all the queries associated with that region, instead of using the aggregate data of its subregions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we classify search queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying web-search queries is challenging. Each query is a few words that can be illusory and ambiguous. So, we look at other signals beyond the query—especially the words and phrases found in the search results. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use supervised machine learning to find the search queries that match the 3 categories. For each of the 3 categories, we trained a neural-network model with a single hidden layer. Each model has 60,000 input nodes, corresponding to words and phrases extracted from the query and the search results using information-gain criterion. We also added features to the model using entities found in the words and phrases (similar to this Google Cloud [entity analysis](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics#entity_analysis)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 shows the top features we used for each category. Some of the features are common across the COVID-19 Vaccination parent category and the subcategories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 1.** Top features used for each category\n",
    "| **Category** | **Top features** |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training our classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained each country’s models in a supervised manner using a sample of search queries made there during 2021— the period typically being a few months. We labeled the training data using a set of simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop the rules, we started by sampling a set of top queries that are associated with web pages about Covid-19 vaccines, Covid-19, or any vaccines. We manually marked each sample query as positive or negative against the three categories. For each category, we created rules from terms, phrases, and entities associated with the positive queries and rarely associated with the negative queries. For example, for the *COVID-19 Vaccination* category we require \"vaccine\" and “covid” to be among the top most relevant terms. Finally we used these rules to automatically label the rest of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluating our classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our classifiers’ capacity to detect queries about COVID-19 vaccinations, we relied on Google’s [*search quality raters*](https://blog.google/products/search/raters-experiments-improve-google-search/) who have deep experience with how health-related information needs are reflected in search queries. These raters were unknown to and independent of the developers of the classifiers. The raters were not aware of this project and did not know the purpose of their task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because only a small minority of Google Searches are for COVID-19 vaccination topics, we needed to create a sample set of queries for evaluation. We used [Google Knowledge Graph entities](https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/) to find queries which included high confidence positives, potential positives, and close negatives. For example, for the classifier used for *COVID-19 vaccination* category, we sampled top and random queries associated with the entity “Covid-19 Vaccination” (high precision), as well as queries that are only associated with the entity “Covid-19” or with “Vaccination” (high recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2 shows the distribution of query ratings for each category. A neutral rating means either multiple raters entered a neutral rating for the query or there was no consensus. Queries that are rated as neutral are excluded from the classifier evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 2.** Distribution of query ratings for the categories\n",

    "### Preserving privacy and quality\n",
    "To preserve user privacy, we use [differential privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc&feature=youtu.be) which adds artificial noise to our data while enabling high quality results without identifying any individual person. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further protect users’ privacy, we ensure that no personal information is included in the data, and we don’t link any related search-based inferences to an individual user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure accuracy after adding noise, we estimate the magnitude of change due to the noise. For the 3 main categories, we retain all the values that (after the addition of noise) have 80% probability to be within 15% of the original value and we remove the noisy values. This sometimes leads to missing data points, as explained in **How we process the data** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because attributing searches to regions relies on [general area estimation](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/179386#location-controls), we don’t report trends for regions smaller than 3sqkm.\n",
    "\n",
